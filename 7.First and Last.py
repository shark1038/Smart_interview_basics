# First and Last bookmark_borderYou are given an array A of size N, containing integers. Your task is to find the first and last occurrences of a given element X in the array A and print them.
#
# Input Format
# The input consists of three lines. The first line contains a single integer N - the size of the array. The second line contains N integers separated by a space, representing the elements of the array A. The third line contains a single integer X.
#
# Output Format
# Print the indexes of the first and last occurrences separated by a space.
#
# Constraints
# 1 <= N <= 103
# 1 <= A[i] <= 105
# X âˆˆ A
#
# Example
# Input
# 10
# 1 3 5 7 9 11 3 13 15 3
# 3

# Output
# 1 9


a=int(input())
b=list(map(int,input().split()))
c=int(input())

first=b.index(c)
last= len(b)-1-b[::-1].index(c)
